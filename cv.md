## Summary

I've always claimed that *I'm too weak to be **a developer***. It seemed to me that it was very difficult (and I still think so, as there is a lot of knowledge to learn) and I wouldn't be able to do it.

However, I decided that I wouldn't give up and show myself that I was wrong and that *I could become a developer!*

I started to learn frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) about two years ago, with ups and downs.

**The milestone** was taking the backend course **[MegaK](https://www.megak.pl)**.

I really focused on learning a year ago, when during the course, in addition to gaining knowledge, I started writing my own code almost every day and learning backend technologies.

During that time I became more familiar with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and NestJS frameworks, learned what a REST API is and how databases work. I learned TypeScript, React, the basics of TDD (Jest) and how GIT works.

During this I wrote my first project [*Fly a Drone*](https://armast.networkmanager.pl) combining [backend](https://github.com/arekmastalerczuk/FlyADroneBack) (Express) and [frontend](https://github.com/arekmastalerczuk/FlyADroneFront) (React). Now I have a plan to refactor BE into **NestJS** and add some features on BE & FE like authorisation and authentication, file handling etc. I also participated in a group project *HeadHunter* where we used NestJS on [backend](https://github.com/Bartlomiej95/GR12-HeadHunter-backend) and React on [frontend](https://github.com/Bartlomiej95/GR12-HeadHunter-frontend) and I experienced the first GIT conflicts in teamwork.

I learned a lot, but there is still a much more to learn ahead of me, and one of the main problems was *the constant lack of time*, so I decided to quit my job and **focus on learning** JavaScript.

I also started studying at [RollingScopes School](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/js-fe-course-en) on the *JavaScript/Frontend* course to further expand my knowledge and grow as a developer. I also showed myself that *I was wrong*, and although it is not easy, but with hard work *I will be able to do what I really like and **become a Junior JavaScript developer!***
